            <p>
                It was a rainy sky of June, but there was no charm or romance to the
                downpour. Instead, the rain fell relentlessly, as if the heavens were shedding
                tears in sync with my own sorrow. The world had become a grey canvas, devoid
                of the joy and vibrancy that should have accompanied the arrival of June.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raindrops fell onto my face as I was lying on the ground. I couldn’t move
                an inch towards her. I couldn’t help but watch her covered with blood, eyes wide
                opened, shattered glass around her, reflecting her face with tears and blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time seemed to stand still as I lay there, the sound of the rain mingling with
                the thumping of my heart. Her face haunted me, etched in agony and despair,
                and my breath caught in my throat. “No, no, this can’t be happening,” I
                whispered, the words lost in the pelting rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every raindrop that touched my skin felt like a cruel reminder of my
                helplessness. I tried to reach out to her, but my body wouldn’t respond. The pain
                was numbing, both physical and emotional, and I felt as shattered as the glass
                around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scene was like a living nightmare, frozen in time. I could see the faint
                outline of people rushing towards us, their voices a distant murmur. Panic and
                fear were etched on their faces, yet it all felt so far away as if I was trapped in a
                bubble of sorrow, disconnected from the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her eyes, once so full of life and love, now held a vacant stare. I desperately
                wanted to wipe away the tears and blood from her face, to hold her close. But I
                couldn’t move, couldn’t even reach out to touch her.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the rain intensified, it mingled with my own tears, blurring the world
                around me even further. It felt as though the rain was weeping for her too,
                mourning the life that had been shattered in an instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to scream, to release the overwhelming emotions within me, but my
                voice remained trapped in my throat. All I could do was lie there, watching her,
                feeling the rain and her pain soak into my skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gods, I pray to you, each and every one of you. If you’re there, please let us
                restart again. I have never once asked you for any favour. But I’m asking now,
                just this one time. Please. I’m begging you. “Please, let us restart again,” I
                muttered.
            </p>

            <h3 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: A Chapter of Ups and Downs</h3>
            <p>After graduating college, I dove headfirst into the job market, eager to land my first programming job. I sent out countless resumes, went through multiple interviews, and faced rejection after rejection. Each "no" chipped away at my confidence, and as the weeks stretched into months, I began to question whether I was truly cut out for the field.</p>
            <p>Then, unexpectedly, I got an email inviting me to interview for a junior developer role at a small, relatively unknown company. It wasn’t a flashy opportunity, but I figured it was a step in the right direction, so I went for it.</p>
            <p>During the interview, I talked about the projects I've done and why I loved programming. The interviewers seemed interested, which gave me a glimmer of hope. But then came the dreaded technical challenge—a problem unlike anything I’d encountered before. My palms were sweaty as I worked through it. I didn’t solve it perfectly, but I managed to present a workable solution. The interviewers were encouraging, but as I walked out, I wasn’t sure how I’d done. Still, for the first time in a while, I felt a flicker of optimism.</p>
            <p>A few days later, the email arrived: they were offering me the junior developer position. It wasn’t the dream job I’d imagined, but it was a solid starting point—and a turning point in my career.</p>
            <p>On my first day, as I sat down at my desk, I was greeted by a warm smile from my desk neighbor.</p>
            <p>“You must be the new guy—Andrew Campbell, right? Nice to meet you. I’m Benjamin Cooper.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, senior. Nice to meet you.”</p>
            <p>“Please, just call me Ben,” he said with a laugh. “We’re desk neighbors, not senior and junior. Let’s be friends.”</p>
            <p>Ben’s energy was infectious. He introduced me to the team and quickly became a mentor and friend. His enthusiasm for programming and life in general was exactly what I needed after the struggles I’d faced. Beyond helping me grow as a developer, Ben took the time to know me as a person, offering encouragement and advice whenever I felt overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Later, I got assigned to a project with Mia Robinson, one of the senior developers. At first, I was intimidated, but I soon realized Mia was approachable and warm. With her sharp hazel eyes and neatly tied dark brown hair, she had a calm yet commanding presence. Her simple, elegant style reflected her practical yet confident personality.</p>
            <p>Mia wasn’t just skilled—she was kind, always willing to guide me without making me feel out of place. I quickly came to admire her balance of professionalism and approachability.</p>
            <p>One evening, after a long day at work, my coworker Daniel popped by.</p>
            <p>“Hey, Campbell, we’re heading out for drinks. Want to come?”</p>
            <p>“I’d love to, but I’ve got a ton of work to finish,” I replied.</p>
            <p>“Come on, when your senior invites you, you can’t say no.”</p>
            <p>Hannah, my fellow newbie, chimed in. “Take a break—it might spark some ideas. Plus, I’m free tonight. I can help you catch up later if you need.”</p>
            <p>“I appreciate it, but—”</p>
            <p>“Just come already!” Hannah insisted, grinning.</p>
            <p>“Alright, alright. You win. I’ll come.”</p>
            <p>As we were heading out, Ben called out to Mia. “Hey, Mia, you joining us?”</p>
            <p>“Can’t, I’ve got a date tonight,” she replied.</p>
            <p>“Skipping out on us now that you’ve got a fiancé, huh?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t make me the bad guy here!” Mia laughed.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say. See you tomorrow!” Ben waved as we left.</p>
            <p>That night, as we all laughed and shared stories, I realized how much I had grown to appreciate my new team. It wasn’t just a job anymore—it was a place where I belonged.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>After wrapping up my work for the day, I headed back to my apartment. It had been a long day, but the thought of my upcoming date night with my fiancé kept my spirits high. As I walked into his place, a smile crept onto my face, imagining the romantic evening we’d share.</p>
            <p>But the moment I stepped into the living room, my world shattered. Standing there, I saw him—my fiancé—locked in a kiss with a half-dressed woman I’d never seen before. It felt like the air was sucked out of the room. My heart thundered in my chest, and everything around me blurred as if I’d stumbled into a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.</p>
            <p>“Wait, let me explain! It’s not what it looks like,” he stammered, panic dripping from his voice.</p>
            <p>But I couldn’t bring myself to hear him out. The image before me said more than words ever could. My chest felt tight, my heart breaking under the weight of betrayal.</p>
            <p>Without saying a word, I turned and ran, tears streaming down my face. Anger, pain, and disbelief surged through me as I tried to make sense of what I had just seen. Staying in that space—with him and the remnants of our broken trust—was impossible.</p>
            <p>For days after, I retreated into myself, barely able to function. I locked myself away from the world, seeking refuge in the quiet solitude of my apartment. The thought of facing anyone—of seeing their pity or judgment—was unbearable.</p>
            <p>The pain was raw and unrelenting, like a wound that refused to heal. I felt exposed, vulnerable, and utterly alone. The walls I built around myself were the only thing keeping me from collapsing completely.</p>
            <hr class="chapter-end">
            <h3 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: Echo of Changes</h3>
            <p>“Hey, Andrew, have you heard from Mia lately?” Ben asked me one afternoon.</p>
            <p>“No, why?” I replied.</p>
            <p>“She hasn’t come to work in weeks. It’s not like her. Even when she’s sick, we have to force her to take a day off.”</p>
            <p>I shook my head. “No, I haven’t. Why are you asking me? You and the other seniors are closer to her than I am.”</p>
            <p>“Well, you two are on the same project, so…”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, and because she hasn’t shown up, I’ve been stuck doing all the work alone,” I snapped. “I don’t even have her number to call her.”</p>
            <p>Ben hesitated before saying, “You should check on her.”</p>
            <p>“Huh? How am I supposed to do that? I don’t even know where she lives.”</p>
            <p>“I can give you her address.”</p>
            <p>“Why don’t <i>you</i> go?”</p>
            <p>“I can’t,” he muttered, looking uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>I raised an eyebrow. “Why not?”</p>
            <p>“There’s... a thing between her fiancé and me. We had a falling out. It’s complicated, and I can’t just show up at her place.”</p>
            <p>“What about the other seniors? Why ask me? I’m drowning in work, remember?”</p>
            <p>“That’s why I’m asking <i>you</i>. If you don’t want to keep doing her work, go and find her.”</p>
            <p>I sighed, frustrated. “Fine.”</p>
            <p>Later, I found myself standing in front of Mia’s apartment, Unit 104. I pressed the doorbell and waited, but there was no response. Impatient, I knocked repeatedly until the door finally creaked open.</p>
            <p>Mia stood there, but she was barely recognizable. She looked frail, as if the weight of the world had pressed down on her. Her face was pale, her eyes puffy and red, her hair unkempt. Her usual polished appearance was gone, replaced by disheveled clothes and an aura of exhaustion and despair.</p>
            <p>I was stunned. The vibrant, cheerful senior I knew was a shadow of herself.</p>
            <p>“Oh, Andrew. Come in,” she said, her voice soft and hoarse.</p>
            <p>I stepped inside, the chaos of her apartment reflecting the turmoil she seemed to be going through. “Sorry about the mess. Can I help you with something?” she asked, forcing a weak smile.</p>
            <p>“…” I had nothing to say.</p>
            <p>“I guess you’re mad at me for not coming to work and leaving you to handle the project alone,” she added, her voice trembling.</p>
            <p>“Senior,” I finally said, “you don’t need to hide it.”</p>
            <p>At those words, the dam broke. Tears poured down her face as her body trembled. She collapsed, and I caught her before she hit the floor. My heart pounded as I carried her to the bed and gently laid her down.</p>
            <p>Once she was resting, I looked around at the cluttered room. Without thinking, I began tidying up, putting things back in order while keeping an eye on her. The mess spoke of weeks of neglect, and as I cleaned, I couldn’t help but wonder what had caused this downward spiral.</p>
            <p>Her usual brightness was gone, replaced by a haunting sadness. I thought of countless possibilities but couldn’t fathom what had broken her so completely.</p>
            <p>After about an hour, she stirred, her eyes fluttering open.</p>
            <p>“You’re awake. How are you feeling?” I asked gently.</p>
            <p>“I... I don’t know. Everything’s a blur,” she mumbled.</p>
            <p>“…”</p>
            <p>“Sorry for dragging you into this mess,” she said weakly. “What a wreck I’ve become. You didn’t have to stay.”</p>
            <p>“I know,” I replied. “And honestly, I wanted to leave. But something kept telling me not to.”</p>
            <p>She looked at me with tear-filled eyes and whispered, “Thank you.”</p>
            <p>I reached out and took her hand. “Senior, I know we’re just colleagues, but you can talk to me. Whatever it is, I’m here. You don’t have to tell me now, but just know you’re not alone.”</p>
            <p>The room grew quiet, the air heavy with unspoken words.</p>
            <p>Finally, I stood up. “Now that you’re awake, I should go. Have a good night, Senior.”</p>
            <p>As I turned to leave, I felt a gentle tug on my hand.</p>
            <p>“Can you... stay a little longer?” she murmured.</p>
            <p>I nodded and sat back down, watching over her as she drifted off to sleep again. Her tear-streaked face looked so vulnerable, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that this moment would mark a change—for both of us.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>I let out a tired yawn, unable to stifle it as the morning dragged on. Hannah’s voice cut through the air, “Campbell’s yawning!”</p>
            <p>“What? What’s wrong with yawning?” I asked, a bit puzzled by her sudden reaction.</p>
            <p>“Nothing, it’s just not like you. What happened last night? Why are you so sleepy today?” she teased, a sly grin spreading across her face.</p>
            <p>I hesitated for a moment, keeping my eyes fixed on the computer screen.</p>
            <p>Ben chimed in, smirking as he leaned back in his chair. “Yeah, something must’ve gone down last night. Spill it!”</p>
            <p>Before I could respond, Ben’s tone shifted to one of genuine concern. “So, did you go see Mia? Is she okay? Did you convince her to come back to work?”</p>
            <p>“No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to bother her. I can handle the project myself—it’s not that bad,” I lied smoothly, avoiding his gaze.</p>
            <p>But the truth haunted me. Images of Mia’s tear-streaked face flashed in my mind, and I couldn’t bring myself to share what had really happened.</p>
            <p>“Be honest. You went on a date last night, didn’t you? That’s why you didn’t go to Mia’s place,” Ben teased, grinning mischievously.</p>
            <p>“What? No, it’s not that!” I shot back, trying to play it off with a nervous laugh.</p>
            <p>Just then, the office went silent as Mia walked in. She wore a long coat that looked out of place in the warm weather, and her teary eyes were hidden behind oversized sunglasses. Her presence was almost eerie, and I could feel everyone’s eyes on her, their curiosity palpable.</p>
            <p>I was the only one who knew why she seemed so distant, and I felt a pang of guilt. I stood and walked over to her, lowering my voice as I whispered, “Senior, you didn’t have to come in today. I can handle the project.”</p>
            <p>She shook her head softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “No, I need to be here. I need to work... I need a distraction.”</p>
            <p>She took a deep breath, then addressed the office. “I want to apologize for my absence these past weeks. I know I’ve caused extra work for some of you, and I’m sorry.”</p>
            <p>The room was heavy with silence, all eyes on her as she continued. “I’ve been going through a difficult personal situation, and I didn’t handle it well. I should have communicated better. For that, I truly apologize.”</p>
            <p>Her voice wavered, and I could sense how hard it was for her to admit this in front of everyone. The sincerity in her words softened the atmosphere, and no one pressed her for details. It was clear she wasn’t ready to share more.</p>
            <p>The rest of the day felt unusually quiet, the weight of unspoken emotions hanging in the air. Though the curious glances continued, everyone seemed to understand that some things are better left unsaid—at least for now.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>I could feel the eyes of my co-workers on me, especially Ben. Their curiosity and worry were almost tangible, but I tried my best to ignore their sympathetic looks. I didn’t want to be seen as weak or someone who needed pity.</p>
            <p>The office felt different—a quiet tension hung in the air. The usual sounds of light-hearted chatter and laughter were gone, replaced by an uneasy silence. Even “Talkative Tom,” who was always bursting with energy, had been uncharacteristically subdued since the morning. It was as if everyone was walking on eggshells, afraid to say or do something that might upset me.</p>
            <p>Amid this tension, Andrew was the only one who treated me the same. He spoke to me like he always did, as if nothing had changed. I couldn’t tell if it was his way of showing support or simply him keeping our relationship as distant and professional as before.</p>
            <p>As the day wore on and the office began to empty, I found myself lingering behind. I wasn’t ready to face the world outside just yet. The solitude of the empty office mirrored the solitude in my heart, and oddly, I found comfort in it.</p>
            <p>When I finally finished my work and packed up to leave, a deep sense of loneliness crept in. The thought of going home felt heavier than usual, like the weight of the world had settled on my shoulders. On my way home, I stopped by a nearby convenience store and grabbed a few bottles of beer. I wasn’t looking for joy—just a momentary escape from the storm in my mind.</p>
            <p>The days that followed were eerily similar. The office remained subdued whenever I was around. It had become an unspoken rule to keep things quiet, as though my presence alone cast a shadow over the usual office energy. Despite all of this, Andrew never changed. He continued treating me like he always had, unaffected by the awkward atmosphere.</p>
            <p>One night, I let myself sink into the numbness of overindulgence. The next morning, hungover and drained, I couldn’t summon the strength to leave my apartment. I skipped work, deciding to stay curled up in the cocoon of my messy living room.</p>
            <p>That evening, there was a knock at my door. Through the haze of my stupor, I struggled to my feet and opened it.</p>
            <p>“Andrew?” I said, surprised to see him standing there. He nodded slightly. “Senior, may I come in?”</p>
            <p>I stepped aside, letting him in. Once inside, he took a moment to glance around the room before turning to me.</p>
            <p>“Senior, why didn’t you come to work today? Are you okay?” he asked, his tone calm but firm.</p>
            <p>“I’m fine,” I replied quickly, trying to brush off the concern. “I just... had too much to drink.”</p>
            <p>Andrew’s expression hardened. “Senior, I’ve been treating you normally because I thought that’s what you needed. But that doesn’t mean I’m not worried. I am worried about you!”</p>
            <p>His sudden shift in tone caught me off guard. Andrew was usually so laid-back, but now there was a seriousness in his voice that I wasn’t used to. It was unsettling but also strangely comforting.</p>
            <p>“Andrew, it’s okay,” I began, trying to calm him down.</p>
            <p>“No, it’s not okay!” he interrupted, his frustration evident. “You and I both know it’s not okay. So, what happened? What exactly happened to make you like this? I’ve thought of so many possibilities, but none of them seem enough to explain what you’re going through. Please, just tell me.”</p>
            <p>His words hung in the air, heavy with concern. For a moment, I hesitated, feeling the weight of his care and the vulnerability of the moment. I realized then that I didn’t have to carry this burden alone. Andrew was offering me something I hadn’t allowed myself to feel in weeks—support.</p>
            <p>“It’s... it’s complicated,” I said softly, struggling to find the right words. But I knew I owed him honesty, so I took a deep breath and continued. “Things fell apart with my fiancé. I thought we had a future together, but it all shattered in an instant.”</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>As soon as the words left my mouth, a wave of regret washed over me. I couldn’t believe I had crossed such a sensitive boundary. Senior would surely hate me now, and the weight of my mistake settled like a stone in my chest.</p>
            <p>I tried to backtrack, to take back the question, but the damage was already done. The room became uncomfortably quiet, the tension hanging thick in the air. I could feel the weight of my words pressing down on both of us.</p>
            <p>“It’s... it’s complicated,” Senior mumbled, her voice barely audible.</p>
            <p>She hesitated, then slowly began to speak. At first, her words came out in fragments, but soon, they started to flow. She opened up about her heartbreak, the betrayal that had left her feeling broken and adrift.</p>
            <p>Her voice trembled as she described sleepless nights spent crying, questioning her self-worth, and grappling with the overwhelming loneliness that had consumed her since that moment of painful discovery.</p>
            <p>I sat in silence, listening intently as she poured her emotions out. I didn’t interrupt or try to offer solutions—I just let her speak. I wanted her to know she wasn’t alone, that I was there to hold space for her pain and be someone she could lean on if she needed to.</p>
            <p>She spoke about the dreams she’d once cherished, now shattered like fragile glass. Yet, as she recounted these experiences, it felt as though she was talking about someone else, not herself. I couldn’t tell if her anger had overshadowed her sadness or if she was masking her vulnerability with a facade of strength.</p>
            <p>I wanted to reach out, to offer her some sort of comfort, but I hesitated. She had built walls around herself, and I feared that trying to breach them would only push her further away. So, I stayed silent, letting her continue at her own pace.</p>
            <p>When her story came to a close, the room fell into a deep silence. I could feel the weight of her words lingering between us. For a moment, neither of us spoke.</p>
            <p>Then, as if driven by some unexplainable pull, I leaned toward her. My heart raced, each beat thunderous in my chest. I hesitated, but before I could second-guess myself, our lips met. The world seemed to fade away as I laid her down gently. There was no resistance, no hesitation from her, and in that moment, we allowed ourselves to be vulnerable together, finding solace in each other’s presence.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>As I stirred from slumber, my eyes met the sight of Andrew lying beside me, deep in sleep. In the soft morning light, I noticed something different about him, something I had never fully appreciated before—the quiet handsomeness of his face. It was as if a veil had been lifted, revealing a side of him I had overlooked all this time. As I continued to gaze at his features, I found myself unable to shake the thoughts about him that began to fill my mind.</p>
            <p>Andrew was a quiet and reserved man, carrying himself with a calm and composed demeanor that contrasted with his more outgoing peers. He often observed from the sidelines, content to blend into the background rather than seeking attention. His introspective nature made him thoughtful and reflective, choosing his words carefully when engaged in conversation.</p>
            <p>With a lean and unassuming build, Andrew didn’t draw immediate attention, but there was a subtle air of confidence in his movements. His dark hair, neatly combed and falling just above his brow, framed his face with a touch of mystery. His deep brown eyes held a sense of depth and intelligence, hinting at emotions he preferred to keep guarded.</p>
            <p>Despite his reserved nature, Andrew was a great listener, always offering a sympathetic ear to those who needed it. His genuine concern for others made him a reliable and dependable colleague, and his loyalty ran deep. Though he rarely initiated social interactions, his close circle valued his quiet presence and unwavering support.</p>
            <p>As I lay there, watching Andrew’s peaceful sleeping form, a torrent of thoughts swirled in my mind. Why couldn’t I tear my gaze away from his face? Why were these emotions bubbling to the surface now? But no matter how much I pondered, I couldn’t find the answers.</p>
            <p>The idea of what I was feeling terrified me. I knew deep down that I wasn’t ready to start a new relationship—not after the pain of betrayal. Andrew wasn’t the kind of person who would hurt me, but the scars of my past loomed large. The fear of being vulnerable again was too much to bear. Taking a deep breath, I reminded myself that forgetting last night and burying these emotions might be the best course of action.</p>
            <p>Andrew stirred awake, his eyes meeting mine with a flicker of surprise. “Senior?” he said, his voice filled with uncertainty.</p>
            <p>The realization of what had happened last night dawned on him, and panic flashed across his face. He seemed at a loss for words, his eyes reflecting a mix of regret and unease. Without hesitation, he apologized, his voice tinged with genuine remorse.</p>
            <p>“I’m so sorry for what happened. I never meant to cross any boundaries or make you uncomfortable,” he said, his words rushed and heartfelt.</p>
            <p>“Let’s just forget about it and move on,” I replied, my voice gentle yet firm. Deep down, we both understood that suppressing the situation was the safest path forward.</p>
            <p>Andrew dressed quickly, the air between us heavy with unspoken emotions. I could see the internal struggle written all over his face, and I wished I could ease his guilt. But I also knew that discussing it further might only complicate things.</p>
            <p>With a final nod, he left, heading back to his place. I was left alone with my thoughts and the tangled mix of emotions I needed to sort through. What happened between us had been a moment of vulnerability and confusion for both of us. Now, it was crucial to find a way to move past it and protect the fragile balance of our lives.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>As I walked back to my apartment, my head hung low, and a heavy sense of guilt weighed down my steps. My feet seemed to drag; each stride was filled with the burden of what I had done. How could I have allowed myself to break Senior’s trust right after she confided in me?</p>
            <p>The night had been filled with alcohol, clouding my judgment and leading me down a path I now deeply regretted. But even in the haze of intoxication, I knew that my actions could not be justified by mere drunkenness. I had betrayed Senior, someone who was already suffering from heartbreak and betrayal.</p>
            <p>She had opened up to me, sharing the raw pain of her past, and in a moment of vulnerability, I had let my own emotions overpower my sense of responsibility. The weight of my betrayal was crushing, and I knew that I had shattered the trust she had placed in me.</p>
            <p>As I replayed the events of the night in my mind, I couldn’t shake the overwhelming guilt that consumed me. How could I have been so careless with someone’s feelings, especially someone who had already been through so much pain?</p>
            <p>That day, the weight of guilt and shame almost convinced me not to go to work. The thought of facing Senior, knowing what I had done, made my stomach churn with anxiety. But with a deep breath and a resolve to face the consequences, I pushed myself to go.</p>
            <p>As I walked into the office, my heart raced, anticipating an awkward atmosphere between us. However, to my surprise, I saw Senior in her usual form, interacting with me normally as if nothing had happened the night before. I couldn’t help but wonder if she had genuinely moved past the incident or if she was gracefully showing her gratitude for being there for her during her darkest hours.</p>
            <p>As weeks passed, instead of growing apart, we found ourselves becoming closer. The barriers that once separated us started to crumble, leading to open conversations about our difficulties, insecurities, and personal challenges.</p>
            <p>In a surprising turn of events, we even became drinking buddies. This became a ritual, providing a space to unwind and momentarily forget our worries. During these moments, we shared laughter, vented our frustrations, and formed a deeper bond. But no matter how hard I tried, I struggled to overcome that one night. She was, after all, my first one-night stand.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>That day remains etched in my memory as if it happened just yesterday. It was a day filled with peculiar events and unspoken tension that lingered in the air.</p>
            <p>As Mia’s fiancé showed up to work and left without a word after not finding her, I couldn’t help but sense that something was amiss in their relationship. The atmosphere felt off, and I knew that there was more to the situation than met the eye.</p>
            <p>My attention was also drawn to Mia’s appearance that day, as she seemed to be wearing a strange dress that caught my eye. And when Andrew approached her, there was an air of concern in his actions, which he tried to conceal. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew something that I didn’t.</p>
            <p>I longed to confront Mia and ask her about what happened, but each time I tried, the words got stuck in my throat. Fear of crossing boundaries or prying into her personal life held me back, and I found myself unable to find the courage to voice my concerns.</p>
            <p>Turning to Andrew for answers, I was met with silence. He seemed to be keeping Mia’s confidence, not willing to divulge any details. The mystery deepened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to Mia’s pain than just a simple breakup.</p>
            <p>Despite the unspoken questions that lingered in the office, life seemed to return to normal. Everyone, including me, resumed communication with Mia as if nothing had happened. Yet, I couldn’t ignore the subtle changes I observed between her and Andrew. They seemed to have grown closer, walking together to Mia’s house or enjoying drinks at a bar.</p>
            <p>I wondered if they were dating, but after seeing Mia suffering so much from breaking up with her fiancé, I knew she wouldn’t date someone that fast and easily. As much as I tried to rationalize their growing friendship, a strange feeling gnawed at my heart whenever I saw them together. It was a mix of emotions that I couldn’t fully understand.</p>
            <p>“Could this be jealousy? Am I developing feelings for Mia?” I questioned myself repeatedly. Despite dismissing the notion due to the circumstances, an inexplicable sentiment lingered, leaving me perplexed and in search of understanding.</p>
            <hr class="chapter-end">
            <h3 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: In the Name of Love</h3>
            <p>One day, Senior didn’t come to work. I barely had time to notice her absence before Hannah broke the silence with the question many of my coworkers had been dreading: “Hey, are you and Mia dating?”</p>
            <p>All eyes turned to me, and I felt the weight of their curiosity. I had seen this coming—Hannah wasn’t one to hold back when something piqued her interest. “No,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. “Why?”</p>
            <p>“It’s just that you two seem closer recently,” she said, her tone teasing.</p>
            <p>I shook my head. “No, we’re not dating. We’re just friends.” The words felt like a lie, even if they were technically true. “Friends with benefits,” I added silently to myself.</p>
            <p>The room fell silent as a stunning woman walked in. It was Grace—my childhood friend and the daughter of my parents’ close friends. Her sudden appearance at my workplace drew surprised and admiring glances from my colleagues.</p>
            <p>Grace walked straight toward me, her presence commanding attention. I couldn’t help but feel a mix of frustration and embarrassment. Why did she always show up unannounced? How had she even found out where I worked?</p>
            <p>We headed to the rooftop to talk. Grace explained that she had come to the city to find a job and needed a place to stay temporarily. She didn’t know anyone else here and asked if she could stay with me. I tried to decline politely, but Grace was as stubborn as ever.</p>
            <p>Just as I was about to refuse, my phone buzzed with a call from my parents. They explained that Grace’s parents had asked them to help her out, and they insisted I let her stay with me. With no way to argue, I reluctantly agreed. I told Grace to wait for me at a nearby café while I finished work.</p>
            <p>Back in the office, Hannah’s teasing resumed. “You cheeky little bastard. I didn’t know you were popular with girls. First Senior, now that cute girl? Sir, you’re a lucky man.”</p>
            <p>“What?” I asked, confused.</p>
            <p>“Your girlfriend. She’s stunning,” Tom chimed in.</p>
            <p>“She’s not my girlfriend,” I replied with a sigh. “She’s just a childhood friend. Our parents know each other, so we automatically became friends. And, for the last time, Senior and I are not dating.”</p>
            <p>“Huh, too bad. You should take a shot. If you don’t, I will,” James joked.</p>
            <p>“Haha, too funny. I don’t like her like that. And I think she has a boyfriend, but we’ve lost touch since I moved here. And no, Tom, I won’t give you her number.”</p>
            <p>“What? I haven’t even said anything,” Tom protested.</p>
            <p>“I know you were going to ask,” I said, smirking.</p>
            <p>The banter continued until the workday ended. I met Grace at the café, and after a brief chat, we headed to my apartment. I cleaned up a room for her and showed her around.</p>
            <p>“Here. Take this room. And don’t you dare try to go into my room,” I warned.</p>
            <p>“Huh? Why would I go into your room? Don’t get too high on yourself. I’m only staying here because I had no other choice,” she shot back.</p>
            <p>“Huh? That’s how you treat your host? You’re lucky your parents called mine. Otherwise, I’d kick you out right now.”</p>
            <p>We bickered, as we always did, but it was harmless. That was just how we were. Over the next three months, Grace turned out to be a surprisingly good roommate, though it was exhausting driving her to job interviews before heading to work. At least I didn’t have to cook anymore—she handled the meals as a gesture of gratitude.</p>
            <p>But being busy with Grace created distance between Senior and me. I noticed she was spending more time with Ben, and it stirred something inside me. A strange, uncomfortable feeling I couldn’t name. Was it jealousy? I tried to dismiss the thought. We weren’t supposed to have feelings for each other, and we had agreed to keep things casual. But no matter how much I tried to convince myself, the pang in my chest wouldn’t go away.</p>
            <p>That kiss. That night. It wasn’t just the alcohol. There was something more, something deeper that I couldn’t ignore. Was it love? The thought terrified me. I couldn’t make sense of my feelings, but one thing was clear: Senior had left an indelible mark on my heart, and I couldn’t pretend otherwise.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>As Mia and I started going out, I couldn’t believe she had said yes to my confession. It was a pleasant surprise, and I looked forward to the moments we would share. It felt like a dream come true to have her by my side, and I tried my best to make her smile and feel cherished.</p>
            <p>However, as the days passed, a cloud of uncertainty began to loom over our relationship. I thought being with Mia would make me happy, but there was a nagging feeling deep inside that something wasn’t right. It was as if my wish had been granted, but I still felt empty.</p>
            <p>Similarly, Mia’s face seemed to be masked by a hint of sadness. It was evident that we both were struggling to find contentment in our relationship.</p>
            <p>During this time, I couldn’t help but notice Andrew and Grace growing closer. Seeing them together sparked an unexpected pain in my chest. It was as if their bond reminded me of something I had been missing.</p>
            <p>And then, in a moment of realization, it hit me. My feelings for Mia were not what I thought they were. I wasn’t in love with her; instead, my heart quietly wanted to be with Andrew. The emotions I had been trying to understand weren’t jealousy but a longing to be with him.</p>
            <p>Soon after my realization, Mia and I both agreed to part ways amicably. In the aftermath of our breakup, my heart was left heavy with the painful realization that Andrew would never reciprocate my feelings. The weight of this truth was difficult to bear.</p>
            <p>I tried my best to push aside my feelings, to hide the pain. I smiled and laughed with our friends, pretending that everything was fine, but deep down, I felt a profound sadness that seemed impossible to shake off. Keeping those in mind, I decided to bury my feelings for Andrew along with my grief.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>It had been a while since Andrew’s childhood friend came to stay at his place, and I had been avoiding him ever since. During that time, something unexpected happened—Ben confessed his feelings to me, and without fully understanding my own emotions, I found myself saying yes to him. It was as if I was trying to fill a void within myself, even though I knew there were no romantic feelings between us.</p>
            <p>As time went on, Ben and I realized that our relationship was built on confusion and uncertainty. We eventually broke up, leaving us both with a sense of relief and confusion about our emotions.</p>
            <p>During this period, I couldn’t help but notice how Andrew and Grace seemed to grow closer. Seeing them together stung my heart in a way I couldn’t explain. It made me question my feelings and wonder if there was something deeper between us that I had been avoiding.</p>
            <p>I had promised Andrew and myself that I wouldn’t allow myself to get emotionally attached to him, but that night we spent together had left me with a mix of emotions. It wasn’t just a moment of vulnerability; there was something more, a feeling I had buried deep within my heart.</p>
            <p>After Grace found a job and moved out of Andrew’s apartment, things between us returned to normal. However, one unexpected day, Andrew came to see me, and his confession caught me off guard.</p>
            <p>As he poured the wine, his words hung heavy in the air, and I couldn’t find my voice to respond. A flood of thoughts and emotions overwhelmed me. I knew I loved him, but the hesitation to say yes weighed on me like an anchor.</p>
            <p>The time I spent with Ben helped me realize that something was missing whenever I was with him, but that emptiness didn’t exist when I was with Andrew. His interactions with other girls, particularly with Grace, also made me realize that I didn’t like the idea of sharing his attention with anyone else.</p>
            <p>For the past three days, I had been absent from work, unable to face Andrew or make a decision. His smiling face kept appearing in my mind, a reminder of the happiness he brought into my life. Yet, with every ounce of love I felt for him, there was also an equal amount of fear and hesitation.</p>
            <p>Why was it so difficult to say yes to the person I love? Was it guilt from the nights we spent together? Were our complicated circumstances standing in the way of our happiness? With those questions spinning in my head, I fell asleep. Why was it so difficult to start a relationship with the person I know I love…</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>It had been three days since I confessed to Senior, and she still hadn’t come to work. I hadn’t expected her to feel the same way, but I couldn’t keep it bottled up anymore—I had to tell her how I felt.</p>
            <p>“Hey, Campbell. Can you drop me off at the mall on your way home?” Hannah asked casually as we wrapped up for the day.</p>
            <p>“Sorry, Hannah. I’m planning to check on Senior,” I replied.</p>
            <p>“Oh, right. She hasn’t been in for three days. Do you know what’s going on?” James chimed in, clearly concerned.</p>
            <p>I shook my head. “No idea.”</p>
            <p>“If you’re going to check on her, I’ll come too. I’m worried about her,” Tom offered.</p>
            <p>“No, you’re coming with me to the bar. You promised, remember?” Ben cut in, nudging Tom. “Let Andrew handle it.”</p>
            <p>Ben’s knowing tone caught me off guard. He always seemed to pick up on things others missed, though he didn’t press further.</p>
            <p>That evening, I found myself standing outside Senior’s house, my heart racing. I took a deep breath and knocked. When the door opened, there she was, wearing her pajamas and looking down at the floor. She wouldn’t meet my eyes, and the sight of her like this made my chest tighten.</p>
            <p>“Senior, I didn’t confess to get an answer,” I said, trying to sound steady. “I confessed because I couldn’t keep it in anymore. I just needed you to know how I feel—”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” she interrupted softly.</p>
            <p>I blinked, confused. “What?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I love you,” she mumbled, her voice barely a whisper. Her words hung in the air, but they hit me like a wave. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.</p>
            <p>For a moment, I stood there in stunned silence. Then, as her words sank in, a smile spread across my face. My heart felt like it might burst. “She loves me,” I thought, the realization sending a rush of warmth through me.</p>
            <p>I gently tilted her chin up so our eyes could meet. Her gaze was full of vulnerability, and it mirrored everything I was feeling. Slowly, I leaned in, my heart pounding so loudly I was sure she could hear it. When our lips met, it was electric—soft and warm, yet intense and full of meaning. It wasn’t just a kiss. It was an unspoken promise, a connection we had been too afraid to acknowledge until now.</p>
            <p>Time seemed to stop as we stood there. I felt everything in that moment—relief, joy, and a deep sense of belonging. It was different from any kiss we’d shared before. This one was real, not just an act of impulse or vulnerability. It was love, pure and simple.</p>
            <p>As we pulled away, I couldn’t help but smile. Her cheeks were flushed, and she looked as if she was about to cry—but in a good way. I wrapped my arms around her, holding her close. The doubts, fears, and unspoken feelings that had been building between us melted away. All that mattered was that we had found each other.</p>
            <p>We spent the rest of the night together at her place. And for the first time in a while, it felt like we were exactly where we were meant to be.</p>
